I have a few projects form the past, that was developed using aegis
software configuration manager [http://aegis.sourceforge.net/]. Since
then I have migrated to tla, and then to git. But I still want some of
the code, still kept in backups of aegis repository.

This project is an attempt to convert my aegis repository into git
format. It wasn't meant to be used by end-users. I only care about
whenever or not this thing will work on my old repos.
