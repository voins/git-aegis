I have a few projects form the past, that was developed using aegis
software configuration manager [http://aegis.sourceforge.net/]. Since
then I have migrated to tla, and then to git. But I still want some of
the code, kept in backups of aegis repository.

This project is an attempt to convert my aegis repository into git
format. It wasn't meant to be used by end-users. I only care about
whenever or not this thing will work on my old repos.

If you want to try converting something yourself, you want to install
recent version of plt scheme [http://www.plt-scheme.org/]. I was using
version 4.1.3 for developing git-aegis. You will obviously need Git
and RCS. Aegis itself is not needed. RCS is what aegis used to keep
history files.

If you have aegis configured to use fhist or aesvt, you're out of
luck, git-aegis doesn't support them. I have never used aegis -merge,
so git-aegis doesn't detect merges and I don't know exactly how it
would behave if there's any.

Using git-aegis is easy:

$ git clone git://github.com/voins/git-aegis.git
$ cd <somewhere>
$ <path-to>/git-aegis -l
project1
project2
...
$ <path-to>/git-aegis project1 project2 ...
